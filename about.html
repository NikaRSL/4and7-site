                <div class="aboutbio"><p>Amy Kelly is a painter whose portraits explore the intersection of personal connections and intercultural symbolism. With a Bachelor of Fine Arts in drawing and a love for watercolor, they bring to life commissioned works that capture the essence of loved ones, pets, and homes. 
                    <br><br>Since 2013, Amy has been teaching art to students ranging in age from 2 to 100. They have a deep passion for the elements of art and art history, with a special love for the Surrealist period, which greatly inspires their work.
                     <br><br>For over 25 years, Amy has also practiced the art of crochet, with a focus on wearable and functional fashion, reflecting their appreciation for craftsmanship and everyday beauty. 
                     <br><br>Influenced by underdog stories, strong women, and the layered complexities of religious and cultural beliefs, Amy imbues their paintings with a sense of resilience and depth. Humor, too, finds its way into their work, adding warmth and relatability. Their art tells stories of human strength, blending narrative and symbolism in ways that resonate across cultures.</p></div>
